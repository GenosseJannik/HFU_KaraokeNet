My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah
Movin? my hips like, yeah

I got my hands up, they're playin' my song
They know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the USA
Yeah, it's a party in the USA
