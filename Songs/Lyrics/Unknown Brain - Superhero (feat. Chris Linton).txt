Like you, be strong to hold the powers of the sun
To dream, believe in strength now I'm the only one, only one
I was an ordinary boy
Until I broke the rules my life destroyed, life destroyed
Until I woke awake scream my mind I shout the ground shakes
How much can I take? My mind will break
Will it break? What can I take?
Can I be your superhero? Superhero
