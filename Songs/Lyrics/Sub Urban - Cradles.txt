I live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
I see the world through eyes covered in ink and bleach
Cross out the ones who heard my cries and watched me weep

I love everything
Fire's spreading all around my room
My world’s so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's alright
Hush
Shh
