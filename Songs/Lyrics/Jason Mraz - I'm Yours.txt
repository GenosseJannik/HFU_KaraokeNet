Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
We?re just one big family
And it's our godforsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved

So I won?t hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate, our time is short
This is our fate, I?m yours
